    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      In life I want to go D1 in soccer get better at schools because at the moment I'm not the best student but I'm working on myself.I'm in the gym everyday I'm 
      running drills to get better at soccer and I'm seeking help with my grades from a friend.I think that self worth and staying on the right track like not hanging
      out with a bad group the most necessary because then I can focus on myself to better myself and stay on the right track so I can get scholarships. I hope to 
      graduate from Naples High school with a 3.0 nothing less and I want to better myself in the nearfuture as in working harder on my school work, during practices 
      and things of that nature. I want to be known as the kid who tried there hardest and got what they wanted on there own I want to be known as a person with good 
      morals and someone who gives back. I think its importaint to show the real you and never hide your true colors. So you could also say I want to be known as an 
      honest and trust worthy person.
